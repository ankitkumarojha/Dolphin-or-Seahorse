System Used: HP Pavilion 15 Notebook (4GB Memory, 1GB 740M Nvidia GPU) which is an average specification.

Convolutional Neural Network:


Steps:
-[Install Caffe]()
-[Install digits]()
-[Download Pretrained Model for AlexNet]
-[Download Pretrained Model for GoogleLeNet]

Creating Datasets
-Usually done by label, but we can segrigate the images into do different folders(one for dolphins and one for seahorses)
-Create new Imagedataset

Model 1 : Training the Alexnet from scratch

-Create new Classification Model

Model 2 : FineTuning and Training the AlexNet

Model 2 : FineTuning and Training the GoogleLeNet
